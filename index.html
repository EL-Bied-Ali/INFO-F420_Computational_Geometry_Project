        <h2>Definitions and considerations</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Polytopes</strong> are shapes with flat faces that we often encounter in geometry. These can be simple 2D shapes like squares or complex 3D structures like cubes. In computer graphics, understanding these shapes is key to creating everything from basic designs to detailed 3D models.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Silhouette</strong> The authors define a silhouette as "the set of edges incident to a visible face and an invisible one" [1]. In simpler terms, it's the outline of a polytope that separates the parts we can see from those we can't, based on our viewing angle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Orthographic projection</strong> is as a form of parallel projection in which all projection lines are orthogonal to the projection plane. This results in every plane of the scene appearing in affine transformation on the viewing surface​​ [2]. In simpler terms, it's a method for creating a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object, maintaining the parallel projection nature of the object being represented [3]​
        </p>
        <p> A <strong>"fat polytope"</strong> is a type of geometric shape characterized by its silhouette and the relationship between its internal and external dimensions. Specifically, for a polytope P to be considered "fat", the ratio (λ) between the radius of the largest sphere that can fit inside it and the radius of the smallest sphere that can enclose it must be relatively balanced, indicated by λ being Θ(1) [1]. This implies that these two spheres are not drastically different in size. Additionally, the maximum apparent length of the polytope's silhouette (L(P)) is proportional to its surface area (A(P)) [1], in other words, a fat polytope has a balanced appearance not just in terms of its internal and external dimensions (spheres) but also in how it appears from an external viewpoint (silhouette).. </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Polytopes with bounded-length edges</strong> is defined as polytopes where all the edges are of a similar length, specifically of length Θ(1)[1] (the length is within a certain bounded range that does not vary significantly).
        </p>
        <p> a <strong>triangulated polytope</strong> A triangulation of a polytope P is a partition of it into simplices such that:
          The union of all them equals P.
          The intersection of any pair of them is a (possibly empty) common face [5] </p>
      </section>
      <section id="paper-overview">
        <h2>Overview of the Paper's Findings</h2>
        <p> The paper "On the worst-case complexity of the silhouette of a polytope" by Helmut Alt, Marc Glisse, and Xavier Goaoc presents an in-depth analysis of polytope silhouettes. One of the key points they discuss is the conditions under which the worst-case size of a polytope's silhouette can be sub-linear, in simpler words, why and when the complexity of a polytope's silhouette doesn't increase as much as might be expected with the size of the polytope. </p>
        <p> This concept is significant because It suggests that under certain conditions, the task of computing silhouettes can be less complex than previously thought, impacting the efficiency of algorithms in rendering and visualization. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="theoretical-contributions">
        <h2>Theoretical Contributions and Key Theorems and lemmas explanations</h2>
        <p> In their study, the authors present a series of lemmas and theorems I will Throughout this report, I'll break down each theorem and corollary of the paper, as I aim to make their meanings as clear as I can given my understanding and explore how they interconnect. </p>
        <h3>Lemma 1</h3>
        <p>Lemma 1 addresses the measure area of convex objects. It states that if you have two convex objects, say O and O', and O contains O', then the measure of the boundary of O (denoted as ∂O) is larger than that of ∂O' [1]. In simpler terms, if one convex shape is completely inside another, the outer shape will have a larger boundary measure compared to the inner one.</p>
        <h3>Lemma 2</h3>
        <p> The lemma states that for a fat polytope P, the maximum apparent length of its silhouettes (the combined length of all the visible edges of the polytope when viewed from a specific angle), denoted as L(P), is proportional to the square root of its surface area, A(P), this is expressed as L(P) = Θ(√A(P)). This means that the longer the silhouette appears from a particular viewpoint, the greater the surface area of the polytope.</p>
        </p>
        <h4>Proof Explanation</h4>
        <p> we look at two spheres related to P: the largest sphere that fits inside P (radius r) and the smallest sphere that completely encloses P (radius λr). Here, λ is a constant, meaning the size of these spheres aren't to different to each other. </p>
        <p> Consider the largest sphere that fits inside the polytope P. This sphere is a convex object, and so is P. According to Lemma 1, because P contains this sphere, the measure of P's boundary (in this case, its surface area) should be larger than that of the sphere's surface. The surface area of a sphere is proportional to the square of its radius (4πr² for a sphere). So, if P contains a sphere of radius r, the surface area of P must be larger than or on the same order as r². </p>
        <p> in the same way for the enclosing sphere, by Lemma 1, P's surface area should also be smaller than or on the same order as the surface area of this enclosing sphere. The enclosing sphere's surface area is also proportional to the square of its radius. Since the radius of the enclosing sphere (λr) is not really different than r (because P is 'fat'), the surface area of P is again compared to r². </p>
        <p> By applying Lemma 1 to both the largest sphere inside P and the smallest sphere enclosing P, and knowing that the radii of these spheres are closely related, we can conclude that the surface area of P (A(P)) must be within the same order as r², hence A(P) = Θ(r²). </p>
        <p> When the polytope P and its spheres are orthogonally projected onto a plane, each sphere projects into a circle on the plane. and since the projection is orthogonal, the radius of each projected circle is the same as the radius of the original sphere. Now, consider the projection of P itself. This projection is a convex shape on the 2D plane. The circles resulting from the projected spheres are also within this projected shape. A pplying Lemma 1 to these projected shapes, we obtain that the boundary length of the projected polytope (the silhouette's apparent length) is larger than the circumference of the smaller circle but smaller than the circumference of the larger circle. Since the circumference of a circle is proportional to its radius, the silhouette's apparent length L(P) is proportional to the radius of the spheres, so we get L(P) = Θ(r). </p>
        <p> So we already proved that A(P) = Θ(r²), and we also proved that L(P) = Θ(r), we get that the <i>maximum*</i> apparent length of the silhouettes is proportional to the square root of the surface area of P: L(P) = Θ(√A(P)). </P>
        <i>Maximun* because these proof holds true from any projection, as apparent length of a polytope's silhouette in an orthogonal projection can vary depending on the angle of projection because different edges and faces of the polytope become visible or hidden as the viewing angle changes and the fact that we are trying to define an upperbound for the approximation</i>
        <h3>Lemma 3</h3>
        <p>Lemma 3 states that a polytope P which is triangulated (see definitions) and have edges of bounded length should have a surface area (A(P)) proportional to the number of edges (n) in the polytope: A(P) = O(n).</p>
        <h4>Proof Explanation</h4>
        <p> The lemma starts with the observation that since the edges of the polytope are of bounded length, the area of each individual triangle in the polytope is also bounded. In simpler terms, each triangle is relatively small and has an area that is O(1), meaning it is constant or does not grow with the size of the polytope. </P>
        <p>Euler's formula for polyhedra (V - E + F = 2, where V is vertices, E is edges, and F is faces) implies that the number of triangles (faces) in a polytope with n edges is also O(n). This is because the number of faces in a triangulated polytope is proportional to the number of edges. (as we can see in Euler formula E increases, F also increases at a similar rate.)</p>
        <p>Therefore since each triangle's area is O(1) and there are O(n) triangles, the total area of the polytope is the sum of the areas of all these triangles. Therefore, the total surface area of the polytope is O(n) x O(1), which simplifies to just O(n).</p>
        <h3>Corollary 4</h3>
        <p>Using lemma 2 (The maximum apparent length of its silhouettes L(P) is proportional to the square root of the surface area of a fat polytope A(P), i.e., L(P) = Θ(√A(P)).) and lemma 3 (the surface area of a triangulated polytope with bounded-length edges is O(n), i.e., A(P) = O(n).), we can deduce a relation between the number of edges of a polytope (n) and the apparent length of it silhouette L(P), i.e., L(P) = O(√n)</p>
        <h3>Lemma 5</h3>
        <h4> introduction to Lemma 5</h4>
        <p>Despite the general upper bound provided by Corollary 4, there's a specific challenge when it comes to individual edges contributing to the silhouette's length. Some edges, especially those nearly parallel to the direction of projection, might contribute very little to the overall apparent length. This means that while the overall silhouette length is bounded, the number of edges making up the silhouette could still be large. To fix this, the authors introduce lemma 5 to add a constraints to ensure that the silhouette remains of sub-linear size </p>
        <h4>Definition</h4>
        <p> Lemma 5 states that if any two incident edges in the polytope make an angle within the range [ε, π − ε], then the silhouette will have a number of edges proportional to its apparent length, O(L(P)). This prevents a situation where a large number of edges each contribute a very small amount to the silhouette, which would lead to a high complexity silhouette </p>
        <h4>Proof Explanation</h4>
        <p>The lemma sets a condition for the polytope P: the angle between any two incident edges (edges must be between ε and π - ε. This prevents the edges from being almost parallel. since When observing P, the silhouette is formed by certain edges. The amount each edge contributes to the silhouette's apparent length depends on its orientation relative to the viewer. With the angle restriction in place, each pair of adjacent silhouette edges contributes a minimum amount to the length, which is at least Ω(ε) (the minimum contribution of these edges to the silhouette's length is proportional to ε).</p>
        <p> So there can only be so many pairs of edges before reaching this maximum length. In other words, the number of pairs of edges ( the total number of edges) is bounded by the maximum length L(P). This is expressed as the number of silhouette edges being O(L(P)).</p>
        <h3>Theorem 6</h3>
        <p>Using collary 4 who states that there is an an upper limit on the apparent length of the silhouette in terms of the number of edges in the polytope, and Lemma 5 that gives a constraint on how the edges contribute to this length. It ensures that despite the number of edges, the silhouette's length is controlled by the contribution of each edge. the authors concludes Theorem which 6 states that for a triangulated fat polytope P with n bounded-length edges, if any two incident edges make an angle in the interval [ε, π−ε], then any silhouette of P will have O(√n) edges</p>
        <h3>Lemma 7</h3>
        <p>Lemma 7 kind ressemble lemma 5 but this time it addresses the angles of edge directions (on the angles that individual edges of the polytope make with a specific viewing direction instead of the angle between pair of edges). The motivation behind this lemma is to understand how the overall directionality of a polytope's (how the edges of the polytope are oriented relative to a given viewing direction) edges affects the complexity of its silhouette. Lemma 7 states that for a polytope P with n bounded-length edges and an apparent length of O(√n), if for any direction δ, the number of edges making a small angle (specifically less than Θ(n^(-1/6))) which is kind of small angle) with δ is O(n^(2/3)), then any silhouette of P will have O(n^(2/3)) edges.</p>
        <h4>Proof Explanation</h4>
        <i> This proof ended up being quite challenging for me, therefore there were some part I couldn't explain in more details than whats already written on the paper even by doing researches, specificaly like why the directions of the n edges being distributed over the sphere make it so one of the caps have to contain Ω(α^2n) edge directions, why the contribution of the edges with larger angles are defined to be bounded by at least Ω(kα).</i>
        <p>lemma 7 proof first define a polytope P with n bounded-length edges, The proof starts by fixing a viewing direction δ and then categorizing the silhouette edges based on the angle they make with δ. The goal is to find a balance between the number of edges making a small angle and those making a larger angle with δ which we will see will contribute to minimizes the overall number of edges of the silhouette. </p>
        <p>To do that the authors considered a sphere enveloping the polytope, where each point with polytope inside, where each edge of the polytope can point toward a points on the sphere, then let δ be represented by some specific point on this sphere, the edges of the polytope that make a small angle with δ are represented by points near δ on the sphere's surface, and those points will form a spherical cap which area will be related to the angle α, according the authors Given that there are n edges (and thus n directions), and the sphere is covered by these caps, at least one of these caps contains a number of Ω(α2n) edge directions. part of the reason I could comprehend is that since those are spherical caps they have an angle of δ, there area is proportional to the angle square α^2, the author conclude that there are at least Ω(α^2n) edges of the polytope that make an angle less than α with the central direction of that cap. This implies that many edges are almost aligned with some viewing direction making them less contributif to the silhouette. and therefore may unnecessarly contribute the increasing the complexity of the silhouette</p>
        <p>Now that we know that some edges contribute minimally to the silhouette, the proof now categorize the edges based on their angle relative to δ.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Edges with higher Angle than α:</strong> These edges, not being aligned with δ, contribute more visibly to the silhouette.
          </li>
          <p>The author denotes those edge as K, Their contribution to the apparent length is quantified as Ω(kα) (the combinate contribution of those edges is at least kα), This means the collective length added by these edges to the silhouette is proportional to kα. Given the silhouette’s total apparent length is O(√n), the number of edges k that contribute significantly (each contributing approximately α to the length) must be such that their total contribution does not exceed this length. Thus, kα is bounded by O(√n), therefore k = O(√n/α)."</p>
          <li>
            <strong>Edges with lower Angle than α:</strong> These edges being almost parallel to the viewing direction contribute less to the silhouette (they don't really alter the silhouette)
          </li>
          <p>To prevent these edges from unnecessarily complicating the silhouette, the proof tries to limit their number usinf the earlier statistical analysis on the sphere which we concluded from that at most O(α²n) edges make an angle smaller than α given a direction δ, in other words we are limiting the number of edges in this category to O(α²n).</p>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that we have those we can get the total number of edges from both groups to minimize the silhouette's complexity. This balance is achieved when the complexities of both groups are equal, i.e., when O(√n/α) equals O(α²n). which results in α = Θ(n^(-1/6)); Therefore we can conclude that means that the silhouette of the polytope P, under the conditions stated in the lemma, will have a complexity that is sub-linear relative to the total number of edges in the polytope</p>
        <h3>Theorem 8</h3>
        <p>By combining both collary 4 and 7, it states that for a triangulated fat polytope with n bounded-length edges (as per Corollary 4), if it meets the edge orientation condition from Lemma 7, then any silhouette of this polytope will have O(n^(2/3)) edges. </p>

        <h1>3D Polytope Silhouette Visualization </h1>          <p>We use Three.js to create and manipulate 3D polytopes. The computational process involves determining which edges of a polytope form the silhouette from the camera's viewpoint. This is achieved by calculating the dot product between face normals and the viewpoint vector</p>

          <p>The practical application of these computations allows us to dynamically generate and display the silhouette of various polytopes (the silhouette is in red, the blue lines help distinguish the faces).</p>

          <!-- Div for THREE.js visualization -->
          <p>I used JavaScript and the Three.js library for 3D graphics to create a 3D scene, showing multiple polytopes (geometric 3D shapes) whose representations can dynamically change based on user interaction. I also implemented the calculation of edge visibility from a given camera perspective, through the algorithm described in the chart below:</p>
          <img src="/src/SE_flowchart.svg" alt="Flowchart">
          <p>The algorithm start by calculating the normal vector of each face of the polytope (which is  a vector  perpendicular to the face which represents its orientation ). Then to determine whether a face is visible from the camera's viewpoint, we compute the dot product between the face's normal vector and a vector pointing from the camera to that face. The dot product, mathematically expressed as N · C = |N||C|cos(θ), where N and C are vectors and θ is the angle between them.
            If the dot product is positive, it indicates that the angle θ is less than 90 degrees, meaning the face is oriented towards the camera and is thus visible. if the dot is negative, it indicates that the face is oriented away from the camera and is not visible [4].
            Now that we got the visible faces, the algorithm proceeds to determine the silhouette edges. These edges are at the boundary between visible and non-visible faces. We check each edge of the polytope to see if it belongs to at least one visible face and one non-visible face. Edges that meets this condition will form the silhouette. [4]</p>
          <p> Additionally, the code calculates the complexity of the visible structure by counting the number of edges apparent from the camera's position. while this project primarily focused on the visualization and interaction with various polytopes in a 3D environment, it shares a thematic with the paper "On the worst-case complexity of the silhouette of a polytope" by Helmut Alt, Marc Glisse, and Xavier Goaoc [1]. While the paper delves into the theoretical aspects of silhouette complexity in polytopes under orthographic projection, the code touches on these concepts through its real-time computation of edge visibility and silhouette rendering. The practical application of silhouette calculation in the code provides an intuitive idea about how different shapes and perspectives can influence the visual representation of different polytopes.</p>
